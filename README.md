### Solana Devnet Airdrop & Enrollment Project

This hands-on project was built as part of the Q2 2025 Solana Prerequisite coursework and is designed to deepen your understanding of Solana development using TypeScript.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for interacting with the Solana Devnet. It covers essential blockchain operations including:

- **Wallet Management:** Generating a new Solana wallet (keypair) and converting between wallet formats.  
- **Token Airdrop:** Requesting SOL tokens from the Devnet.  
- **Token Transfer:** Executing transfers, including fee calculations and emptying a wallet.  
- **Course Enrollment:** Interacting with a Turbin3 enrollment smart contract using Anchor and Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).

## Project Structure

- **keygen.ts**: Generates a new Solana wallet (keypair) and outputs both the public and secret keys.  
- **convert.ts**: Provides utility functions for converting wallet formats (e.g., between Solana’s byte array format and Phantom’s base58-encoded string).  
- **airdrop.ts**: Connects to the Solana Devnet and requests airdropped SOL tokens.  
- **transfer.ts**: Transfers SOL tokens from your Devnet wallet to a designated Turbin3 wallet. It includes logic to calculate fees so the account can be emptied correctly.  
- **enroll.ts**: Uses Anchor to interact with the Turbin3 enrollment smart contract, submitting your GitHub account details and completing the enrollment process.  
- **package.json & tsconfig.json**: Project configuration files detailing dependencies, scripts, and TypeScript settings.

## How It Works

**Wallet Generation:** Utilizes [@solana/web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) to create and manage secure keypairs.  
**Token Management:** Simulates a real-world workflow by requesting airdropped tokens and handling transfers with precise fee calculations.  
**Smart Contract Integration:** Leverages Anchor to connect with a deployed enrollment program on the Solana Devnet, using a PDA to securely link your account to the enrollment process.  
**Conversion Utility:** Provides conversion between Solana’s wallet format and Phantom’s base58 format using the `bs58` package.
